# wordcloud_app
Generation of wordcloud from excel file for the analysis of open ended answers.

For the app usage one will need an excel file with a column 'answer' with rows representing answers of unique users, as well as columns containing information about the users, such as age, gender, income etc. 

The app allows filtering data by the filter columns (all but 'answer'), adding/removing stopwords for representation of open-end answers as a wordcloud png file.
